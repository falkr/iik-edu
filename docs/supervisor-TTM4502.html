<p>The evaluation and grading must be documented by filling in an evaluation and feedback form for each report. The form will be made available to the student·s, who should take it into account when starting working on his/her/their master’s thesis.

Milestones should be put at reasonably regular intervals (~ average 3rd week, at end of tasks) where specific intermediate results should be ready. Milestones should enable tracking of the progress of the work. Dependencies between tasks and if relevant external input, should be identified. Visual support, e.g., as a Gantt diagram, is a pre.

<div class="row g-0 my-3"><div class="col-md-8 px-4 chunk"><h3>How to proceed</h3>
<p>It is common practice for the external evaluator and the main supervisor to first go through the report individually and afterwards discuss and agree upon the evaluation and feedback during a physical or on-line meeting. It can also be handled by e-mail, but it might be less efficient.</p>
<p>As for filling in the form, this may be handled by both preparing comments that are merged after the coordination meeting (this is usually done by the external evaluator); alternatively, one of the parties may make a draft that is supplemented by the other.</p>
</div><aside class="col-md-4 chunk ps-2"></aside></div>
<div class="row g-0 my-3"><div class="col-md-8 px-4 chunk"><h2>Presentation day</h2>
<p>On the presentation day, there are as many parallel tracks in different rooms as there are external evaluators. Unless otherwise indicated, the programme starts at 09:15 and finishes at the lastest at 15:00.</p>
<p>Each presentation lasts for 20 min.; 15 min. for the presentation of the project and 5 min. for questions and comments from the audience. The presentation, questions, comments and answers <em>must</em> be in English.</p>
<p>To ensure and stimulate participation, each student/group shall at least ask one question to at least one other students/groups according to a prepared schedule distributed with the detailed programme for the day. Of course, they may all also ask questions/give feedback to other students/groups as well.</p>
<h3>Who attends the presentations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The external evaluator who is also the session chair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The students that are presenting. It is compulsory for the students to attend all the sessions in the track in which they are themselves presenting. Exceptions are however made for students that have another exam on the same day. Students must be physically present in the room unless otherwise agreed upon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main supervisors and the co-supervisors working at the department are expected to attend the sessions where the students they have be supervising are presenting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone at the department, employees and students, is invited to come.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div><aside class="col-md-4 chunk ps-2"></aside></div>
<div class="row g-0 my-3"><div class="col-md-8 px-4 chunk"><h3>Practicalities</h3>
<p>When it is his/her/their turn to present, the student·s should join the MS Teams meeting for the track and share his/her/their screen. The audio on his/her/their laptop should be turned off and the student·s should use the microphone available in the room.</p>
<p>This setup allows those that cannot attend physically (main or co-supervisors and/or students) to attend on-line and removes the need for any cables/converters.</p>
<p>To be sure that those following on-line also hear the questions that are asked from the audience in the room, the student·s should repeat the questions before answering them (this also allows the student·s to get a confirmation that he/she/they have understood them correctly).</p>
