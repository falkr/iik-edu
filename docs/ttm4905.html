<h3>Reuse of text from the pre-project report</h3>
<p><strong>(adapted from a note originally written by Prof. Bjarne E. Helvik on
Feb 12, 2020)</strong> @TODO minor editions</p>
<p>There have been questions concerning the reuse of text from pre-project
(TTM4502) report in the master's thesis. Many students put a lot of
effort into the pre-project report and find it challenging to provide a
well-formulated and compact presentation of the motivation, related work
and others, that should go into the project report. Hence, they would
like to reuse parts of their project report and consider a rewrite to be
a “waste of effort”. On the other hand, students are aware that such a
reuse of text might be considered as “plagiarism”. The objective of this
section is to provide guidelines and some background information.</p>
<p>The short version is that the problem of not being allowed to reuse text
from the project report, without risking being accused for plagiarism,
is more of a conceived problem than a real one. Reuse of own material is
ok as long as it is evident that it is reused.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Background</p>
<ul>
<li>Plagiarism is the process or practice of using another person's
ideas or work and pretending that it is your own.</li>
<li>&quot;Self-plagiarism&quot; refers to the reuse of own material without
explicitly stating that this material is made available,
published or used earlier. It is fundamentally different from
plagiarism since it does not involve &quot;stealing&quot; from others, but
refers to presenting something as new work when it is not.</li>
<li>Self-plagiarism is illegal if there are restrictions on reusing
the material, for instance:
<ol>
<li>The copyright is owned by others than the author. This is
the case for most publications authored by scientific staff
at the department.</li>
<li>Work done by students to complete a course or degree cannot
be reused for a later course or degree (if this is done, it
is considered as cheating; §6-4
[https://www.ntnu.no/documents/16067/1269570488/Forskrifter.pdf/9511b9be-5258-4549-9c1e-b4fd69c99ace-
@TODO - link to lovdata] (in Norwegian)).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Self-plagiarism in reporting research is considered as
unethical, also when it is not illegal.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that plagiarism, including self-plagiarism, is not
restricted to the reuse of text, it also encompasses the
semantics of the content, including the lines of reasoning, the
ideas, the results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the master's thesis</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevant text from the project report may be reused if it is
clearly and explicitly stated that it is adopted from the
project report. The best way of doing this is with</li>
<li>Self-plagiarism in the master's thesis of project work, that is
reuse of material without explicitly stating it, is not
acceptable as per the study regulations.</li>
<li>Tools for checking the similarity between texts are available.
These will however not be misused; a student will not be
automatically accused of self-plagiarism if a few identical
sentences pop-up in a (revised) text that contains a substantial
amount of new content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two additional points</p>
<p>It causes confusion that the concept of plagiarism is used
differently in copyright legislation and in research ethics.
Rewriting one’s own text may be (and is) used to avoid copyright
infringements. However, if the content is the same, it is still
considered as self-plagiarism from a research-ethical perspective.
Hence, rewriting well-formulated text in transferring material from
the project report to the master's thesis just to change the wording
is a waste of effort. Even if rewording is done, the original work
should still be cited.</p>
<p>Reusing text and unaltered content from the project report (with
citations) may seem a good way to get started. However, during the
work on the thesis, the student will most likely get a revised,
deeper and/or more extensive insight into the topics that he/she
explored in the project. Hence, it is highly recommended to take a
critical look on what is “reused”, and to amend it based on the new
insights. In most cases, this will result in such a substantial
amount of new content, it will not be deemed as self-plagiarism in
the case the self-citation is omitted. (Note also that not amending
text from the project report may leave the impression that no
progress has been made on these subtopics after 20 weeks of work.)</p>
<p>@check project/pre-project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examples of how self-citations may be stated</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Referring to formulation of research questions:</p>
<p>Much focus in the project work is put on the research
questions(s)/objective formulation. If these are kept unaltered
after the feedback on the project report and the initial work on
the master's thesis - it may be stated as follows: &quot;The research
questions(s) / objective(s) from the project is/are maintained
[NesYY]. &lt;&lt;formulation of the research question(s) /
objective(s)&gt;&gt;&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Referring to a reused subsection, e.g. related work:</p>
<p>Reuse of a complete subsection may be formulated as: &quot;The state
of art and related work were reviewed, and an identification of
the relevant background material were carried out in the project
preceding this thesis [NesYY]. No relevant new material was
found during the work on the thesis. The presentation from the
project report is included below. &lt;&lt;Text on related
work/SoA/etc.&gt;&gt;&quot;.</p>
<p>Reuse of a substantial part of a subsection may be formulated
as: &quot;The state of art and related work were reviewed, and an
identification of the relevant background material were carried
out in the project preceding this thesis [NesYY]. This is
amended with discussion of a few papers that have become
available (been studied, been published, or…) after the project.
&lt;&lt;Text on related work/SoA/etc.&gt;&gt;&quot;.</p>
