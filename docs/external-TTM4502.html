<div class="row g-0 my-3"><div class="col-md-8 px-4 chunk"><p>This is a preliminary project for the master's thesis for master's students at the department in Trondheim.</p>
<p>The course is assessed as passed/not passed based on the written report that the students submit, but it is also compulsory for students to present their project during a presentation day.</p>
<p>The students may work either alone or in groups of two on a project under the supervision of one or more supervisor. The main supervisor is also an associate professor or a professor at the department. Co-supervisors may be
others associate professors, professors, researchers, post-doctoral fellows or Ph.D. candidates at the department or people that are external to the department and possibly the university</p>
<p>The project topics have either been proposed by the one of the supervisor and selected by the students or by the students themselves in colloboration with one of the supervisors.</p>
<p>The report must have a maximum of 15 pages, the structure is given, and the students must use <a href="https://v2.overleaf.com/read/zmdtrkxxsjyq">this LaTeX template</a>.</p>
<p>Students that do not submit a report or whose report is graded &quot;not passed&quot; may submit a (revised) version at the end of January.</p>
<p>There are <a href="bruk-av-ki.html">guidelines for the use of AI Tools</a> and the students are required to submit an AI declaration form when submitting their report.</p>

The department normally appoints 4-5 external evaluators so they each evaluate and grade 10-12 reports.</p>
<p>In order for a report to be graded as passed, all the work items c) – f) and h) listed in the <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTM4502">course description</a> under 'course content' must be addressed in a passable manner. Also work item g) must be addressed in a passable manner if specific tools are planned to be used in the work. The assessment criteria for each of the work items are detailed below and are communicated to the students at the beginning of the semester by the course coordinator.</p>
<p>The evaluation and grading must be documented by filling out an evaluation and feedback form for each report. The form will be made available to the student·s, who should take it into account when starting working on his/her/their master’s thesis. All the forms should be submitted to the <a href="mailto:liv.k.stubberud@ntnu.no,laurent.paquereau@ntnu.no">department's administration</a> within a month after the presentation day.</p>

<p>It is common practice for the external evaluator and the main supervisor to first go through the report individually and afterwards discuss and agree upon the evaluation and feedback during a physical or on-line meeting. It can also be handled by e-mail, but it might be less efficient.</p>
<p>As for filling out the form, this may be handled by both preparing comments that are merged after the coordination meeting (this is usually done by the external evaluator); alternatively, one of the parties may make a draft that is supplemented by the other.</p>
</div><aside class="col-md-4 chunk ps-2"></aside></div>
<div class="row g-0 my-3"><div class="col-md-8 px-4 chunk"><p>Since you will have to have meetings with several different main supervisors, it is recommended that you plan a process that suits you and then contact them to inform them of that process.</p>

<div class="row g-0 my-3"><div class="col-md-8 px-4 chunk"><p>On the presentation day, there are as many parallel tracks in different rooms as there are external evaluators. Unless otherwise indicated, the programme starts at 09:15 and finishes at the latest at 15:00.</p>
<p>Each presentation lasts for 20 min.; 15 min. for the presentation of the project and 5 min. for questions and comments from the audience. The presentation, questions, comments and answers <em>must</em> be in English.</p>
<p>To ensure and stimulate participation, each student/group shall at least ask one question to at least one other students/groups according to a prepared schedule distributed with the detailed programme for the day.

<p>You/the external evaluator/session chair.</p>

<p>The students that are presenting. It is compulsory for the students to attend all the sessions in the track in which they are themselves presenting. Exceptions are however made for students that have another exam on the same day. Students must be physically present in the room unless otherwise agreed upon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main supervisors and the co-supervisors working at the department are expected to attend the sessions where the students they have be supervising are presenting. Because of travels and other pressing activities this is

</div><aside class="col-md-4 chunk ps-2"></aside></div>
<div class="row g-0 my-3"><div class="col-md-8 px-4 chunk"><p>It is of course up to you. As session chair you should invite for questions from other attendees. It may be hardest to get them from the students, but once a student asks a question, it may inspire others. It is as an advantage that you as external evaluator ask challenging questions. It should also be a preparatory training for what students will encounter after their studies and being able to present their own work and ask critical questions after listening to someone else presenting are part of the general competence the students should acquire through this project. If relevant, it is also an opportunity to give the student(s) the possibility to clarify parts of the report and for you to gain better insight into what has been done and what is planned and a better idea of his/her/their actual understanding, which can be helpful for the evaluation. Some external evaluators also choose to end with a short oral feedback to the student(s) – adapted to the setting, but still indicating where improvements may be made.</p>
</div><aside class="col-md-4 chunk ps-2"></aside></div>
<div class="row g-0 my-3"><div class="col-md-8 px-4 chunk"><h3>Practicalities</h3>
<p>When it is his/her/their turn to present, the student(s) should join the MS Teams meeting for the track and share his/her/their screen. The audio on his/her/their laptop should be turned off and the student(s) should use the microphone available in the room.</p>
<p>This setup allows those that cannot attend physically (main or co-supervisors and/or students) to attend on-line and removes the need for any cables/converters.</p>
<p>To be sure that those following on-line also hear the questions that are asked from the audience in the room, the student(s) should repeat the questions before answering them (this also allows the student·s to get a confirmation that he/she/they have understood them correctly).</p>
