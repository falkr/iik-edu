Each master's thesis is to be jointly evaluated and graded by an external and an internal evaluator, both nominated by the department. The internal evaluator is also the administrator of the evaluation committee. The internal evaluator must not have been involved in the supervision of the student·s. If any of the evaluator has a conflict of interest that the department has not been made aware of during the nomination process, please inform the [department's administration](mailto:liv.k.stubberud@ntnu.no,laurent.paquereau@ntnu.no).

The evaluation and grading is based on the thesis and a brief report from the main supervisor. The work is to be assessed according to the criteria that are normally used for scientific technological works such as conference contributions, journal papers and similar. The assessment criteria are detailed below and are communicated to the students at the beginning of the semester by the course coordinator. The evaluation should take into account the technological and scientific challenge posed by the task, as well as what can realistically be expected to be achieved within the duration of the master’s thesis work (20 weeks, full-time). 

There are [guidelines for the use of AI Tools](bruk-av-ki.html).

The evaluation and grading must be documented by filling in an evaluation form. The evaluation form must be submitted to the [department's administration](mailto:liv.k.stubberud@ntnu.no,laurent.paquereau@ntnu.no) and the grade must be registered in Inspera – see below –  within 12 weeks after the submission of the thesis. The form will be made available to the student·s and the main supervisor

**Evaluating, grading, filling in an evaluation form and submitting it, and registering the grade in Inspera in time is the joint responsibility of both the external and the internal evaluator.**

### Summary and overall evaluation

All experience shows that the final evaluation is best based on an overall judgment of the quality of the work. We recommend that equal weight is put on the four main groups of criteria. There is no similar recommendation for weighting of the sub-criteria. These recommendations are embedded in the evaluation form.

With respect to the sub-criteria such as challenge, novelty and utility, it is mainly the responsibility of the main supervisor to ensure that the problem/task formulation is relevant and that it will be possible for the student's/s' work to meet these criteria. The student/s is/are normally not in a position to do this when the problem/task is chosen.

In preparing this part of the form and in establishing the grade, please consult [NTNUs generic description of MSc thesis grades for the NMT area](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Description+of+grades+for+master+thesis). The use of concepts and terms should be consistent. A guideline for converting an evaluation in percent points to the A-F scale is available [here](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Grading+scale+using+percentage+points).


## How to proceed

It is common practice for the evaluators to first go through the thesis individually and afterwards discuss and agree upon the evaluation and grading during a physical or on-line meeting. This can also be handled by e-mail, but it might be less efficient. 

As for filling in the form, this can be handled by both preparing comments that are merged after the coordination meeting (this is usually done by the external evaluator); alternatively, one of the parties can make a draft that is supplemented by the other.

## Quality assurance

The evaluation should be quality assured according to the following [procedure for quality assurance of the evaluation of MSc theses (pdf)](https://edu.iik.ntnu.no/assets/Prosedyre%20kvalitetssikring%20sensur%20masteroppgaver%20IIK.pdf) (_in Norwegian_).
