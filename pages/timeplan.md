# Course scheduling (for course coordinators)


Once it is decided that a course is to be given a given semester, the course coordinator has two tasks:
- register course schedule data the semester before the course is given, and
- control the tentative timetable for the course once a draft is available.

See [https://ntnu-timeplanprosessen.webflow.io/](https://ntnu-timeplanprosessen.webflow.io/) for a presentation of the entire course scheduling process at NTNU and innsida for the [academic calendar](https://i.ntnu.no/studiekalender).

The course coordinator should check that:
- all the activities that should be scheduled are indeed scheduled, that
- all the activities are planned according to what you registered in [TP: Basic data](https://tp.educloud.no/ntnu/grunnlagsdata/), that
- for each activity, the type of activity and staff is correct and, if any, that the allocated room is suitable, that
- the activities are both scheduled the weeks they will occur and not scheduled the weeks they will not occur, and finally
- if you are teaching in more than one courses, that teaching times are not colliding.

Problems/errors should be reported to the administration, see [Contact](https://edu.iik.ntnu.no/timeplan#contact) below.

Information about a specific room, incl. the available equipment, is available in [TP](https://tp.educloud.no/ntnu/timeplan/?type=room). 


* **Deadline:**
    - June and November for courses to be given in the autumn and in the spring, respectively. The actual dates depend on the deadlines set by the central administration.
* **System:**
    - [TP:Course](https://tp.educloud.no/ntnu/timeplan/emner.php?lang=en) (select the relevant semester in the drop-down menu on the right and search for the course by course code.) and [TP:staff](https://tp.educloud.no/ntnu/timeplan/timeplan.php?type=staff&lang=en) (select the relevant semester in the drop-down menu on the right.)
