### Scientific and technological challenge and results

- **Challenge**: Is the task the application of known methods on a standard class of problems, or are any of these new? Have similar tasks been dealt with before? What are the requirements for abstraction and innovation? A simple task must never be given a top grade.
- **Substance of the results**: Has the student built a (working) implementation? Were simulations carried out and/or analytical results obtained? Has the student produced a specific, unambiguous design, or is a thorough trade-off between alternatives based on sound criteria performed? It should be taken into account that working towards concrete results may require time to get equipment, software, etc. configured and up and running.
- **Broadness**: What are the prerequisites in terms of maturity and overview of the field? How broad are the issues addressed and what is their scientific/technical/disciplinary span?

### Significance and originality

- **Novelty**: Does the work give new facts, ideas or insights? Are there innovative elements? 
- **Relation to the state-of-the-art**: Has the student shown sufficient insight into and overview over the problem domain? Does the manuscript include representative references to other work within the domain? Is the student able to put their own work into a wider context and the work of others? The references and bibliography are important in this context.
- **Utility**: Is the work practically or theoretically useful? With respect to this criterion, be aware that it is the relevance of the work with respect to the formulation of the task that is evaluated, not the relevance of the (given) task itself.
- **Autonomy**: What has the student achieved by themselves from the given task/problem? For a fair evaluation, the evaluator must be informed about the evolution of the problem formulation throughout the project, as well as the support provided to the student.”.

### Methodological quality

- **Method**: Is any method used in the work, and is there an explicit choice of method (if relevant)? Are suitable formalisms chosen and used?
- **Methodological reliability**: Are the methods used and the investigations done sufficient to support the conclusions?
- **Logical consistency**: Are there contradictions in the report? Do the observations support the conclusions? Are there alternative interpretations of the observations? Is the basis for the conclusions (e.g. the observations) complete?
- **Procedural quality**: Is the working procedure well-documented and is any quality assurance with respect to the work/results carried out? When the task is to develop a (software) system, the SW quality (in the broad sense; documentation included) should be taken into account.

### Presentation

- **Structure**: Is the report written in a manner that makes it easy for the reader to get an overview over starting point/objectives, what is done and the conclusions/results, and to maintain this overview throughout the reading? Does the report contain the necessary elements such as abstract/summary, table of contents, introduction, etc.?
- **Clarity**: Is it easy/possible/difficult/impossible to follow and understand what is written? Are proper references given with regard to the source of claims and information? Are the references in the list complete?
- **Information density**: Is the relation between content and volume satisfactory? How long is it between the “golden nuggets”? Are information about details unnecessary for progression of the reading put into appendices?
- **Style**: Does the student make a distinction between essentials and details? Is the work interesting or boring to read? Is there an overview chapter/section (cf. structure) which makes the work more accessible?
- **Illustrations and tables**: Are illustrations and tables clear, reasonably “self-contained” and informative, or is there a duplication between text and illustrations/tables. Could some of the text be better presented/conveyed in the form of illustrations or tables?
