This is a preliminary project for the master's thesis for master's students at the department in Trondheim. 

The course is assessed as passed/not passed based on the written report that the students submit, but it is also compulsory for students to present their project during a presentation day.

The students may work either alone or in groups of two on a project under the supervision of one or more supervisor. The main supervisor is also an associate professor or a professor at the department. Co-supervisors may be
others associate professors, professors, researchers, post-doctoral fellows or Ph.D. candidates at the department or people that are external to the department and possibly the university

The project topics have either been proposed by the one of the supervisor and selected by the students or by the students themselves in colloboration with one of the supervisors.

The report must have a maximum of 15 pages, the structure is given, and the students must use [this LaTeX template](https://v2.overleaf.com/read/zmdtrkxxsjyq).

Students that do not submit a report or whose report is graded "not passed" may submit a (revised) version at the end of January.


## Evaluation of the reports and grading

Since you will have to have meetings with several different main supervisors, it is recommended that you plan a process that suits you and then contact them to inform them of that process.


## Presentation day


:tip:
The detailed programme for the day is distributed by e-mail at the latest a week ahead of the presentation day. 


On the presentation day, there are as many parallel tracks in different rooms as there are external evaluators. Unless otherwise indicated, the programme starts at 09:15 and finishes at the lastest at 15:00.

Each presentation lasts for 20 min.; 15 min. for the presentation of the project and 5 min. for questions and comments from the audience. The presentation, questions, comments and answers *must* be in English.

To ensure and stimulate participation, each student/group shall at least ask one question to at least one other students/groups according to a prepared schedule distributed with the detailed programme for the day. Of course, they may all also ask questions/give feedback to other students/groups as well.


### Who attends the presentations


* You/the external evaluator/session chair.

* The students that are presenting. It is compulsory for the students to attend all the sessions in the track in which they are themselves presenting. Exceptions are however made for students that have another exam on the same day. Students must be physically present in the room unless otherwise agreed upon.

* The supervisors and the co-supervisors working at the department are expected to attend the sessions where the students they have be supervising are presenting. Because of travels and other pressing activities this is
unfortunately not always the case.

* Everyone at the department, employees and students, is invited to come.


### Role as session chair; passive listener or challenging questioner?


It is of course up to you. As session chair you should invite for questions from other attendees. It may be hardest to get them from the students, but once a student asks a question, it may inspire others. It is as an advantage that you as external evaluator ask challenging questions. It should also be a preparatory training for what students will encounter after their studies and being able to present their own work and ask critical questions after listening to someone else presenting are part of the general competence the students should acquire through this project. If relevant, it is also an opportunity to give the student·s the possibility to clarify parts of the report and for you to gain better insight into what has been done and what is planned and a better idea of his/her/their actual understanding, which can be helpful for the evaluation. Some external evaluators also choose to end with a short oral feedback to the student·s – adapted to the setting, but still indicating where improvements may be made —.


### Practicalities

When it is his/her/their turn to present, the student·s should join the MS Teams meeting for the track and share his/her/their screen. The audio on his/her/their laptop should be turned off and the student·s should use the microphone available in the room.

This setup will allow those that could not attend physically (main or co-supervisors and/or students) to attend on-line and will remove the need for any cables/converters.

To be sure that those following on-line also hear the questions that are asked from the audience in the room, the student·s should repeat the questions before answering them (this also allows the student·s to get a confirmation that he/she/they have understood them correctly).



## Remuneration and travel expenses claim


The remuneration covers 2 hours per report, 4 hours for pre- and post-work for all the tasks together, as well as the time spent on the presentation day.

Your travelling expenses would also be covered by the Department.
